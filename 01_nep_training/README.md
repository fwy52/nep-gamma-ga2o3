# NEP Training for γ-Ga2O3

This directory contains all input and output files for the neuroevolution potential (NEP) training of gamma-Ga2O3.

## Key File Descriptions

- nep.txt- The final trained potential function file, used for subsequent calculations of thermal conductivity, phonon spectra, and other properties
- nep.in- Input parameter file for NEP training
- Other output files- Various log and result files generated during the training process

## Plotting Scripts

The plotting scripts used in this work are based on the code from the [tang070205/tools](https://github.com/tang070205/tools/blob/main) repository and have been modified according to the specific requirements of this study.

## Usage Instructions

Use the trained `nep.txt` potential function file for molecular dynamics simulations to calculate physical properties such as thermal conductivity and phonon spectra.
