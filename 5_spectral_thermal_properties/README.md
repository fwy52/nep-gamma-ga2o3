## Key File Descriptions

Each directional folder contains:
- **NEMD calculation output**: `Gc.npy` file (used as input for subsequent HNEMD calculations)
- **HNEMD calculation results**: Data files for spectral thermal conductivity and phonon mean free path

## Results Analysis

By analyzing the spectral thermal conductivity and phonon mean free path distributions across different sites (Ga2/Ga3/Ga4) and crystallographic directions, we can gain deep insights into the contribution of phonons to thermal transport and their scale effects in gamma-Ga2O3.
