## Key File Descriptions

Each directional folder contains:
- **NEMD calculation output**: `Gc.npy` file (used as input for subsequent HNEMD calculations)
- **HNEMD calculation results**: Data files for spectral thermal conductivity and phonon mean free path

## Code Source

The scripts used for spectral thermal conductivity and phonon mean free path calculations in this work are based on the code from the [tang070205/tools](https://github.com/tang070205/tools/blob/main) repository and have been modified and adapted according to the specific requirements of this study.

## Results Analysis

By analyzing the spectral thermal conductivity and phonon mean free path distributions across different sites (Ga2/Ga3/Ga4) and crystallographic directions, we can gain deep insights into the contribution of phonons to thermal transport and their scale effects in γ-Ga2O3.
